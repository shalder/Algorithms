We've used Vector Space model. The corpus consists of around 1550 documents. 
	python ir.py
	

Type in your query when you're asked on console. The ranked results will be displayed, with docid and weight. On typing the empty query(i.e. just pressing enter) the program will exit.

Source of the Dataset: http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/ 
					   20 Newsgroups sorted by date; duplicates and some headers removed. Our corpus consists of 1500 documents. 
					   
You can run the code on other documents to by pasting the documents in the corpus folder and rename the documents as doc**** where **** is a 4 digit number.
NOTE: 1. Because we have used the Vector Space model, the terms precision and recall do not apply.
      2. We've given the output in ascending cosine score (ascending order of relevance) so that the most relevant result can be seen on that page itself. (You won't have to scroll up to get to the first result.)
